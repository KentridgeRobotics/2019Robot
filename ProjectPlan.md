# Project Plan for 2019 Robot

## Ideas

- Climber system to get onto the hab third level
- Visual recognition of vision targets on hatches.
- Drive train controls: teleop steering and throttle
- Brake button on the xbox controller
- Turbo button to go faster
- Or switch to toggle between fast and slow, or a gearshift
- If the robot has multiple gears, a real gearshift.
- Recognize lines on the field (maybe using infrared sensors on the bottom of the robot)
- Calibrate and test visual recognition
- Small automatic functions: place a hatch cover, place a cargo ball, pick up hatch cover, pick up ball
- Make dashboard configuration for competition that only has information useful to the driver (no diagnostics)


## Schedule

1. Driving, gear shifts, turbo, brakes
2. Create diagnostic dashboard
3. Visual sensing, image recognition
